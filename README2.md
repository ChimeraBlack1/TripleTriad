Cube game version 2


Hello!

The intended purpose of this game is to test/improve my abilities in javascript while providing a piece for my portfolio.
This game is not meant to make money so if you want to pull it and create your own version, by all means go ahead.

The game has 9 slots and the two players have 6 cards in-hand.  There is no card drawing.  In later evolutions there may be or we may
do something else entirely.  For the purposes of the folio piece, the cards will have static values.  
The player will select a card and place it on the board by clicking an open slot, or by dragging the card onto it.

The enemy AI will be designed to compare the card placed to the cards in its hand, decide what a good move is,
and place a card onto the board, ending it's turn.

The game will end whenever the 9 slots on the board are full.  Whoever has the most cards still alive on the board, wins.

The game then asks you if you would like to play another.  If you do, the board is cleared and the hands are re-filled.

Thanks for reading!
